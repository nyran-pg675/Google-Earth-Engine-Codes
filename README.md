# 🌍 Google Earth Engine Repository
📘 Introduction
This repository is intended as a space to share general Google Earth Engine (GEE) codes. It includes scripts related to my internship projects, academic work, and self-taught practice in remote sensing and GIS.

The purpose of this repository is to make commonly used GEE codes more accessible and reusable, helping others explore environmental applications such as land cover mapping, NDVI analysis, water quality monitoring, and rainfall visualization.
